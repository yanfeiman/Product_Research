0,R1Z8PKDXMMBBUV,5.0 out of 5 stars A great deal for a great case,SmithLutz,5,"I bought this for my 10 year old about a year ago to replace the heavy, hard-sided one that her rental instrument came in. She needed something that was easier for her carry while walking to and from school: lightweight, but sturdy and protective. She was also new to the instrument and I didn't want to invest a lot of money on something I wasn't sure she would stick with. This case fit all the requirements. It is incredibly light, but keeps the violin well protected, and is reasonably priced. The bright color is an added bonus that my daughter loves. There isn't a lot of storage inside, but enough to hold what she needs for her lessons at school - really just rosin and a cloth. There are two front pockets where she stores her shoulder rest and lesson book. After a year's use, the zippers and velcro are still in good working condition and the case still looks great. She gets a lot of compliments on it!","Reviewed in the United States December 6, 2020",AGFUTA2NZKWCTEYIFNNI735JZNZQ,True,3.0,Color: MintStyle: Shaped Case,B009IDT5ZG
1,R2Y5I3IEXSQQXJ,5.0 out of 5 stars 000 hand made violin and needed a sturdy protective case,Diana,5,"I recently purchased a $4,000 hand made violin and needed a sturdy protective case. I purchased the oblong case (not the violin shaped case) and it came within a few days. I've only had this case a few weeks. The case was impressive from the start. The exterior seems to be made of a strong material that doesn't seem like it would tear easily and should be easy to wipe down if needed. The interior has strong sides with good padding which made me feel confident that it would offer very good protection from bumps and falls. The clip that holds the bows are anchored securely and have a good strong feel to them. The strap that holds the violin inside the case also has a strong feel to it and keeps the instrument very secure. I have a full size violin and it sits snuggly inside (no wiggle room). The inside compartment has enough room for my shoulder rest, rosin and tuner. The outside of the case has a full length zippered pocket so I can put my music books and other items in it. I asked my violin teacher to look at the case as I wanted his opinion on whether this case would protect my instrument. After all, when you spend $4,000 on an instrument, you want to keep it safe! I am happy to report that he gave it high praises. I take my violin to lessons, church and other places so I feel confident that the case will protect the instrument. Although I don't need all of the different straps, it's nice to have the shoulder strap so my hands are free to carry other things. The case has a handle on the end so you can pick it up and stand it on its end. I really love the color (fuscia) because it's different from most cases. Of course the price is very reasonable which is another good feature. The only thing I would change is that the handles to carry it around are clothe and it comes with a Velcro strap to keep them together. I would prefer a plastic handle (one) instead of 2 clothe handles but this is not a deal breaker for me. I would highly recommend this case.","Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2016",AGISHAZS65LNUL5PFJXE4CSIUVCQ,True,20.0,Color: MintStyle: Shaped Case,B009IDT5ZG
2,R2QEMU3NC9FVKD,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Case,C. Reeves,5,"I absolutely love this case. I ordered two cases at the same time. This one and the Sky Lightweight Shaped Violin Case for my two violins. This one has quality construction, great straps, feels well balanced and looks fantastic. I bought it in the ""Mint"" color which is really more of a turquoise teal type color (which I was hoping it would be because it's my favorite color). Love it because it doesn't blend in with all the other black cases at practices. I did have to wait longer for it to arrive because of my color choice but it was worth the wait. The pocket on the front is just about big enough to put my folder and music books into - can zip to about 2"" of the corner of the books. Also has a second pocket on the front where I store my shoulder rest. I've attached a photo showing how the books look zipped in when there is also a shoulder rest in the other pocket. There are 3 music books (one Suzuki if you're familiar with the size of those books) and a folder full of additional sheet music in this photo. Doesn't zip all the way but close enough for me to make for easy transport. Love this case much more than the Sky one I purchased at the same time. That one is smaller and not nearly as balanced or as good of quality.","Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2017",AHEJSHKAXA37GLMGWXJ7DZIEANLQ,True,10.0,Color: MintStyle: Shaped Case,B009IDT5ZG
3,R1XCPAA7QXL638,4.0 out of 5 stars I consider this case just fine. Here were my concerns at the time of ...,Amazon Customer,4,"I'll start by saying that I consider myself an advanced violin player. My old case was literally falling apart, and I began my case searches here on Amazon. A lot of the cases seemed extremely overpriced, while this Protec case seemed fairly reasonable. The tag ""student"" violin case should be considered a misnomer. As a lower-level professional, I consider this case just fine. Here were my concerns at the time of purchasing:Is my bow going to fit in without it spreading rosin all over the inside of my case?Yes. Through some clever design, the bow is lifted so that the hair of the bow does not come into contact with the case. There are no rosin issues.Will it be able to fit all of my accessories/sheet music?Sort of. There is a small compartment on the inside that has enough room for rosin, a cleaning towel, and a tuning fork. However, there is no inside compartment large enough for a shoulder rest. For some violinists, beginners particularly, a sponge will fit just fine below the neck of the violin within the case. For others, the shoulder rest must go in awkwardly into the larger bag-pouch up front. I also store in there an electric tuner and electric metronome. There is no conceivable pouch to hold music books or sheet music. This part, I don't mind much, as I think it'd be better to keep the music in a separate bag anyways.And, most importantly, how much does it actually protect my instrument?Unfortunately, not very much. For those that have instruments over $5000, I would have to recommend they find some other case. I have a violin below that number, and I still consider this an effective insurance against basic forms of damage. The case is very solid. Almost certainly, if I drop the case or accidentally hit it against something, I feel confident my instrument would not come to harm. The case seems sturdy and well-built. I would be comfortable using the shoulder-straps of the case and ride on my bike with no fear of the case tumbling out of my control. It seems improbable that the case would open up on its own and the violin dropping onto the floor.Like I said, the case is well designed for basic safety needs. However, this case will probably not be able to withstand an adult accidentally stepping on the case (although for children, I am fairly confident the case would still be fine). Obviously, other freak forms of damage such as flooding, fire, or tornado, would be outside of the intention of the case's design.Some nice features that I was happy to discover once I've gotten the case is probably a good summary of why I like it so much. The outside (handles, rings for shoulder strap or backpack harnesses, pouches, zipper, multitudes of velcro safety measures) all provide a solid feel of comfort, both on carrying and on conscience. The inside does leave a little bit to be desired for, but I have learned to improvise around it.For $50, the case gives me the protection that I desired and then some. Hope it does for you too.","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2016",AHJKVTSYFYSG4LEXMYSPX3HU4D4Q,True,22.0,Color: BlackStyle: Shaped Case,B009IDT5ZG
4,R3GO1E1P91NTNO,5.0 out of 5 stars Confortable,Annie Perez,5,"Great case, lightweight and comfortable. Lots of space for sheet music in exterior pocket, and dual pocket is great for additional items like pencils, erasers, chin rest etc. my only complaint is that I typically put my chin rest next to the scroll of my violin, but it‚Äôs a very tight fit. Would recommend putting the chin rest in an exterior pocket.","Reviewed in the United States May 1, 2023",AFHQ7OZRZWIFDWR7ZGMJSEHR7NYA,True,1.0,Color: PurpleStyle: Shaped Case,B009IDT5ZG
5,RR9IR2P7ETVXU,5.0 out of 5 stars Protec 4/4 violin case AWESOME üëçüëçüëç,hawk_507,5,"I just didn't trust the cheap case that came with my violin. I knew Protec cases were awesome because I have owned one for 30+ years for my trumpet! That trumpet case made it through Jr high, high school, football games, marching competitions, trips, etc and is still in like-new condition! This violin case is the same quality and will last a lifetime. The pictures don't do it justice. It is only similar to the cheap cases in shape, but that's where it stops. All the materials used in the Protec case are superior. It has a nice weight due to the quality materials. If you're thinking about it, go for it! You will be pleasantly surprised! I highly recommend. üíØ","Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2023",AE3Z6VKIK62HIEE2HNTZXAQMX4QA,True,3.0,Color: BlackStyle: Shaped Case,B009IDT5ZG

My daughter loves this case and how easy (and safe/secure) it makes transportation, even on the bus!Slight problem with missing backpack straps, but as always Protec was easy to work with and sent replacements.

7,R3CBYN1614U7AH,5.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful case!,Laura Austin Halikman,5,I bought this case to replace the one my daughter had messed up taking her violin back and forth to school. She really messed her first case up. This one seems to be heavier duty than the one that came with the violin. It has lasted and still looks new. She has had it for. I want to say a little bit more than 2 months now. And it looks great. So I would say it is very sturdy and well-made.,"Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2023",AFXNA44BCXVMOURY3Q5I4UIZLXUA,True,2.0,Color: PurpleStyle: Shaped Case,B009IDT5ZG
